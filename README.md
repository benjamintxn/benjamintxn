# Hello, I am Ben! :wave:
## 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a postgraduate at King’s College London pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated with a First Class Honours in BEng Electronics and Computer Engineering at the University of Nottingham, where I developed skills in software development, software testing, and programming. With my keen interest in Cybersecurity, AI, and IOT, I aspire to apply my knowledge and passion when creating innovative and impactful solutions for real-world problems.
## 🖥️ Skills

## 💡 What I Am Working On
## 💡 What I Have Worked On
- Participated in ESA's ‘Orbit Your Thesis’ programme, contributing to the development of an experiment cube for the ISS, focusing on interface setup between the cube and the ICE Cubes Facility (ICF).
  - Designing and implementing communication and data transfer strategies, including telecommand functions using Raspberry Pi, for a ground-to-ISS link via a control centre in Belgium.
  - Developing software for telemetry, command, and data handling at the ground station, utilising the YAMCS software framework for efficient space mission control.
  - Engaging in interdisciplinary collaboration within a team of UG and PhD students and staff, applying software and electronics engineering skills to ensure mission viability and adherence to stringent safety standards.
- Given a full CAD model of the 2021 University of Nottingham Formula Student car. It is incredibly detailed - over 3,700 individual components, and some of the bearings are modelled down to each individual ball bearing.
  - The ultimate aim is to create software that allows interactive simulation of this model - allows the user to change the colour of parts, apply special effects, pull parts off in VR, etc. This is broken down into two main project phases that will be attempted as a group:
    -  Phase 1: Develop a PC based Graphical User Interface application that can load the CAD model and allow the user to made modifications such as changing part colour, adding/removing parts, applying special effects to part. The model will be viewed using a standard 3D view in the GUI application.
    - Phase 2: Add a VR output module to the software. Use this to develop the software that works with the HTC Vive Pro 2 VR system.
